            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Simple beef, vegetable, tamarind based soup that we eat over rice! A meal in itself!</p>
            <p>All the delicious flavors you would get in sinigang - the sourness of sampaloc, the fresh okra, kangkong, labanos, and tomatoes - is added to the heartiness of tender beef rib chunks that you'd normally get in a nilaga. </p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
